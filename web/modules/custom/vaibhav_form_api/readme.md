# RSVP Form API Module

## Overview
The RSVP Form API module provides functionality for site visitors to RSVP to events via a form that collects email addresses. The module includes a configurable form, AJAX submission handling, and an administration interface to enable/disable the RSVP functionality site-wide.

## Features
- AJAX-powered RSVP form for collecting email addresses
- Admin configuration page to enable/disable RSVP functionality
- Customizable display message
- Database storage of RSVP submissions
- Form validation for email addresses
- Seamless user experience with dynamic feedback

## Installation
1. Download and place the module in your `/modules/custom` directory
2. Enable the module through the Drupal admin interface (`/admin/modules`) or use Drush:
   ```bash
   ddev drush en vaibhav_form_api
   ```

## Configuration
1. Navigate to `/admin/config/content/rsvp-list`
2. Toggle the "Enable RSVP functionality" checkbox to enable/disable the RSVP form
3. Customize the display message that appears above the RSVP form
4. Click "Save configuration"

## Usage
The RSVP form can be displayed in two ways:

### As a Block
1. Go to Block layout (`/admin/structure/block`)
2. Place the "RSVP Form" block in your desired region
3. Configure visibility settings if needed

### As a Page
The RSVP form is available at `/rsvp` and can be linked from anywhere on your site.

## Permissions
This module defines the following permissions:
- `administer rsvplist`: Allows users to access the RSVP settings page
- `view rsvplist`: Allows users to view the RSVP form

## Database Schema
The module creates a `rsvplist` table with the following structure:
- `id`: Auto-increment primary key
- `mail`: Email address of the RSVP submission
- `nid`: Node ID associated with the RSVP
- `uid`: User ID of the submitter
- `created`: Timestamp of submission

## Troubleshooting
If the RSVP form is not appearing:
1. Check if the module is enabled
2. Verify that the RSVP functionality is enabled in the configuration
3. Clear the Drupal cache
